# Setup Instructions

The download/installation instructions for several tools are described below.

It is recommended to install all tools into a directory called `install/` (can be changed via `export INSTALL_DIR=...`).

#### Notes

Utilities in the [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory are used to select the appropriate files to download and unpack them automatically.

Most tools are hosted [here](https://github.com/PhilippvK/riscv-tools/releases) and can be manually downloaded via:

```sh
wget https://github.com/PhilippvK/riscv-tools/releases/download/gnu_2024.09.03/riscv64-unknown-elf-ubuntu-20.04-rv32gc_ilp32d.tar.xz
```

or similar.
